# Demystifying AI to Empower Your Business

Mike G Robinson - Founder

After a fulfilling 30+ year career, I recently took six months to completely immerse myself into AI. With no objectives other than to explore, evaluate and validate some of the opportunities I had come across, my head was quickly spinning with ideas.

For 2-3 solid months I researched, then evaluated firsthand, AI products across several verticals. In most cases I used these products and compared them to their counterparts. I also discovered 'vibe-coding' and have developed a number of Apps now at various stages of development - all without knowing how to code.

I knew I had a new mission: demystifying AI and empowering businesses to harness its' potential to free up resources that can be repurposed elsewhere. Automation by its nature, transforms the way we look at business processes and AI replaces repetitive and / or structured tasks as well as many unstructured. Automation is now possible on a level never seen before but that's not because AI has changed automation software. The advancement in automation software platforms is because of their connect-ability and useability; easy to use and will connect to almost anything.

I eventually settled on a stable of favored products centered around Google, but there's no shortage of choice, so it's difficult to be anything but agnostic. The market is surging with exciting consumer-level AI products, driven by innovative startups capitalizing on the latest AI breakthroughs. But although the market is fertile for these AI driven solutions, it's not for the faint hearted. What's popular one day can lose their base subscribers overnight when a new player offers increased functionality, speed and / or reduced cost.

Cost remains a major driver, the closer a product gets to the consumer market the more pressure they face to either reduce subscription costs, offer a free tier or both. Nevertheless, the age-old economic adage "there's no such thing as a free lunch", still applies, you'll only get so far on a free subscription.

Opening up your business to automation is a door to abundant choices. Rich functionality and a myriad of datasets await behind every API door, and you now have a key. Using platforms like make.com, n8n and zapier, businesses can now effortlessly tap into this treasure trove of options to do business smarter. Through API's you can introduce AI to your business processes down to the individual process step providing a world of options at every minute part of your operation.

This blog and website are the outputs of this time but represent a distillation of my experiences through my career. I don't profess to have mastered all so I'm developing a library of supporting articles to plug certain gaps in the narrative. I hope that over time I can help others understand, not only automation and AI, but some of the building blocks of business.
