![This Automation Was Made For You](/images/home-banner.webp)

This automation was made especially for <a href="#" onclick="triggerSubscribePopup(); return false;"><strong>you</strong></a>.

<br>

Literally, it was made for <a href="#" onclick="triggerSubscribePopup(); return false;"><strong>YOU</strong></a>. And <a href="#" onclick="triggerSubscribePopup(); return false;"><strong>you</strong></a>, and <a href="#" onclick="triggerSubscribePopup(); return false;"><strong>you</strong></a>...

<br>

This automation relies solely on <a href="#" onclick="triggerSubscribePopup(); return false;"><strong>you</strong></a>.

<br>

This automation has one purpose... <a href="#" onclick="triggerSubscribePopup(); return false;"><strong>you</strong></a>.

<br>

This automation is nothing without <a href="#" onclick="triggerSubscribePopup(); return false;"><strong>you</strong></a>.

<br>

This automation is just another piece of code... without you.

<br>

This automation sends you an email when you sign up for my Blog.

<br>

So do your thing. Hit the button. This one here. There's one at the bottom and another at the top.

<br>

If nobody sees a tree fall in the forest with no-one around to hear it?

<br>

We don't want to philosophise, we need <a href="#" onclick="triggerSubscribePopup(); return false;"><strong>you</strong></a> to do your part.

<br>

Does an automation exist if it's not engaged?

<br>

Please sign up to my Blog, the life of an automation is relying on you.
