# Deployment Verification Attempt (2025-10-27)

## Objective
Run the equivalent checks from `verify-deployment-fix.bat` against the live Pages deployment for https://mgrnz.com.

## Method
Executed `curl` requests for the three endpoints covered by the Windows batch script:

1. `https://mgrnz.com/deployment-timestamp.txt`
2. `https://mgrnz.com/build-info.txt`
3. `https://mgrnz.com/admin/` (with HTTP basic auth credentials `admin` / `admin`)

## Results
All three requests were blocked by the environment proxy (`HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden` with body `Domain forbidden`), preventing a comparison between the live deployment and the repository state.

| Endpoint | Command | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `deployment-timestamp.txt` | `curl -i https://mgrnz.com/deployment-timestamp.txt` | `HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden` / `curl: (56) CONNECT tunnel failed, response 403` |
| `build-info.txt` | `curl -i https://mgrnz.com/build-info.txt` | `HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden` / `curl: (56) CONNECT tunnel failed, response 403` |
| `admin/` | `curl -i -u admin:admin https://mgrnz.com/admin/` | `HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden` / `curl: (56) CONNECT tunnel failed, response 403` |

## Conclusion
The diagnostic checks could not reach the live Pages deployment due to proxy restrictions in the execution environment. No live asset hashes, timestamps, or admin responses were obtainable. Additional verification will require network access that is not blocked by the proxy, or assistance from Cloudflare support using these findings.
