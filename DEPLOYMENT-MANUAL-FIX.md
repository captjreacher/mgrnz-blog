# 🚨 GITHUB PAGES - MANUAL INTERVENTION REQUIRED

## CRITICAL ISSUE CONFIRMED

**Problem**: GitHub Pages is doing PARTIAL deployments
- ✅ Static files updating (deployment-timestamp.txt, build-info.txt)
- ❌ Hugo layouts NOT updating (admin/create/, admin/posts/)
- ❌ Template changes stuck in deployment queue

## IMMEDIATE MANUAL ACTIONS REQUIRED

### 1. Go to GitHub Pages Deployment Dashboard
1. Visit: https://github.com/captjreacher/mgrnz-blog/actions/workflows/deploy-gh-pages.yml
2. Locate the most recent run for the **Deploy Hugo to GitHub Pages** workflow
3. Inspect the jobs for build or deploy failures

### 2. Check Build Logs
1. Open the latest workflow run
2. Review the **Build Hugo site** and **Deploy to GitHub Pages** steps
3. Confirm the job finished successfully without template errors

### 3. Manual Deployment Trigger
1. From the workflow run page click **"Re-run all jobs"**
2. If a rebuild is required, push an empty commit: `git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger GitHub Pages rebuild"`
3. Wait for the workflow to finish and confirm the site redeploys

### 4. Clear Cached Artifacts
1. Navigate to the repository **Settings > Pages** section
2. Disable and re-enable GitHub Pages if the workflow appears stuck
3. Re-run the deployment workflow afterwards to publish the latest build

## FALLBACK OPTION: Manual Publish

If the automated workflow is blocked, build locally and publish manually:

```bash
hugo --gc --minify --buildFuture
npm run deploy:gh
```

The `deploy:gh` script should push the contents of the `public/` directory to the `gh-pages` branch.

## EXPECTED COMMITS TO BE DEPLOYED

These commits are stuck and need to go live:
- `b894405`: Force deployment: add test post to trigger Hugo rebuild with admin changes
- `9dd40bd`: Embed admin content directly: working create and posts management interfaces
- `a49a79d`: Fix admin routing: use URL path matching for create and posts pages
- `88afcc5`: EMERGENCY FIX: Remove auth loop, auto-authenticate, clean interface
- `5707112`: Add admin debugging: show page info and partial loading status
- `eef8342`: Fix admin page routing: integrate create and posts forms into main admin layout
- `86238a8`: Add admin debugging: bypass, debug mode, and test auth button
- `2ab4d24`: Remove conflicting admin system: eliminate browser prompt, use only main admin interface
- `6c4befb`: Fix admin authentication: add debugging, test page, and bypass option
- `ce23921`: Fix admin routing: update layouts to use proper admin system, add create form partial
- `f8a3cbe`: Fix admin system: hide webhook test, update dark theme, fix layout conflicts
- `8abb5a1`: Deploy complete admin system: authentication, post creation, and management interface

## VERIFICATION

After manual intervention, check:
1. https://mgrnz.com/admin/ (should show auth screen)
2. https://mgrnz.com/admin/create/ (should show dark theme)
3. https://mgrnz.com/deployment-timestamp.txt (should show b894405)

## THIS IS THE DEFINITIVE SOLUTION

The deployment pipeline is broken at the GitHub Pages level and requires manual intervention to restore functionality.
