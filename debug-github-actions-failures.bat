echo üö® GitHub Actions Failure Investigation
echo.

echo ‚ùå REALITY CHECK: All GitHub Actions workflows are FAILING
echo.
echo From the GitHub Actions page, I can see:
echo - "Add verification script for blog fixes" - FAILED
echo - "Fix blog posts visibility and admin authentication" - FAILED  
echo - "Resolve merge conflict in CV post" - FAILED
echo - "Update post: My CV" - FAILED
echo.

echo üîç NEED TO INVESTIGATE:
echo 1. What specific errors are occurring in the workflow logs?
echo 2. Is it a permissions issue?
echo 3. Is it a Hugo build error?
echo 4. Is it a deployment step failure?
echo 5. Is it a submodule issue?
echo.

echo üìã NEXT STEPS:
echo 1. Check the specific error logs in GitHub Actions
echo 2. Look at the workflow file for issues
echo 3. Test the exact same commands locally
echo 4. Fix the root cause of the failures
echo.

echo üéØ The fact that local testing works but GitHub Actions fails
echo    suggests an environment difference or configuration issue.
echo.

echo Please share the specific error message from the failed workflow logs
echo so I can diagnose and fix the actual problem.
echo.
