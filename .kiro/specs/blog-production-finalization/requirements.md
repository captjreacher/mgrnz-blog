# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature spec covers the final production deployment of the mgrnz.com blog site. The system currently has a Hugo-based blog with admin functionality, MailerLite integration for subscriptions, and GitHub Actions for deployment. The goal is to resolve remaining issues and ensure a fully functional production deployment at https://mgrnz.com.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Admin Authentication

**User Story:** As a site administrator, I want secure access to the admin interface through the home page link, so that I can manage blog content without unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the Admin link on the home page (bottom left) THEN the system SHALL require authentication before granting access
2. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect to the admin dashboard
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and remain on the login screen
4. IF the admin link exists without authentication THEN the system SHALL implement proper authentication flow

### Requirement 2: MailerLite Subscription Integration

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to subscribe to the blog newsletter, so that I receive updates when new posts are published.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits the subscription form THEN the system SHALL send their email to MailerLite via API
2. WHEN the API call is successful THEN the system SHALL create a new contact in MailerLite
3. WHEN the API call fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message to the user
4. IF no contacts are being created in MailerLite THEN the system SHALL diagnose and fix the API integration
5. WHEN testing the integration THEN the system SHALL verify new subscribers appear in MailerLite dashboard

### Requirement 3: MailerLite to GitHub Blog Post Integration

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to create blog posts in MailerLite and have them automatically published to the Hugo site, so that I can manage content from a single interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a blog post is created in MailerLite THEN the system SHALL receive the content via Supabase webhook
2. WHEN the webhook is triggered THEN the system SHALL format the content for Hugo
3. WHEN content is formatted THEN the system SHALL commit the new post to the GitHub repository
4. WHEN the commit is made THEN the system SHALL trigger the site rebuild process
5. IF webhook integration is missing THEN the system SHALL implement the complete webhook flow

### Requirement 4: GitHub Actions Deployment Pipeline

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic site rebuilds when content changes, so that new posts and updates are immediately available to visitors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN changes are committed to the repository THEN GitHub Actions SHALL trigger automatically
2. WHEN GitHub Actions runs THEN the system SHALL build the Hugo site successfully
3. WHEN the build completes THEN the system SHALL deploy the updated site to the live environment
4. WHEN deployment completes THEN the changes SHALL be visible at https://mgrnz.com
5. IF the Hugo site is not rebuilding with updates THEN the system SHALL identify and fix the deployment pipeline issues
6. WHEN testing the pipeline THEN the system SHALL verify that commits result in live site updates

### Requirement 5: Production Domain Configuration

**User Story:** As a site owner, I want the blog to be accessible at https://mgrnz.com, so that visitors can find the site at the intended production URL.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users navigate to https://mgrnz.com THEN the system SHALL serve the Hugo blog site
2. WHEN the domain is configured THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS with valid SSL certificates
3. WHEN DNS is configured THEN the system SHALL properly route traffic to the hosting platform
4. IF the current setup doesn't serve from mgrnz.com THEN the system SHALL configure the proper domain routing
5. WHEN domain configuration is complete THEN the system SHALL verify the site loads correctly at the production URL

### Requirement 6: System Integration Validation

**User Story:** As a site administrator, I want all components working together seamlessly, so that the blog operates reliably in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all components are deployed THEN the system SHALL validate end-to-end functionality
2. WHEN testing the complete flow THEN subscription forms, admin access, content creation, and deployment SHALL all function correctly
3. WHEN issues are identified THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and logging
4. IF any existing functionality is broken THEN the system SHALL preserve all working features while fixing issues
5. WHEN validation is complete THEN the system SHALL document the final production configuration
