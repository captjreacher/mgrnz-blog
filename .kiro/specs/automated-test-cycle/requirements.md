# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature spec covers the development of a comprehensive automated test cycle system for the mgrnz.com blog deployment pipeline. The system will continuously monitor and track all triggers, webhooks, and deployment processes from MailerLite through Supabase to GitHub Actions and final production deployment. This monitoring system will provide real-time visibility into the entire content creation and deployment workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Deployment Trigger Monitoring

**User Story:** As a site administrator, I want to monitor all triggers that force a rebuild and redeploy, so that I can track what causes site updates and ensure reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any content change occurs THEN the system SHALL detect and log the trigger source
2. WHEN a manual deployment is initiated THEN the system SHALL record the trigger type and timestamp
3. WHEN GitHub Actions workflow starts THEN the system SHALL capture the triggering event details
4. WHEN a webhook triggers deployment THEN the system SHALL log the webhook source and payload
5. IF multiple triggers occur simultaneously THEN the system SHALL track each trigger separately with unique identifiers

### Requirement 2: MailerLite to Supabase Webhook Tracking

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to monitor webhook records from MailerLite to Supabase, so that I can verify content is being received and processed correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MailerLite sends a webhook THEN the system SHALL log the complete webhook payload
2. WHEN Supabase receives the webhook THEN the system SHALL record processing status and timing
3. WHEN webhook processing fails THEN the system SHALL capture error details and retry attempts
4. WHEN webhook authentication occurs THEN the system SHALL log authentication success or failure
5. IF webhook delivery is delayed THEN the system SHALL track delivery timing and identify bottlenecks

### Requirement 3: Supabase to GitHub Webhook Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to track webhook records from Supabase to GitHub, so that I can ensure content changes trigger the deployment pipeline correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Supabase processes content THEN the system SHALL log the GitHub API call details
2. WHEN GitHub receives the webhook THEN the system SHALL record the API response and status
3. WHEN GitHub Actions is triggered THEN the system SHALL capture the workflow initiation details
4. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL log error responses and retry mechanisms
5. IF rate limiting occurs THEN the system SHALL track API usage and throttling events

### Requirement 4: GitHub Actions Workflow Monitoring

**User Story:** As a site administrator, I want to monitor GitHub Actions workflow execution and resulting commits, so that I can track the build and deployment process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GitHub Actions workflow starts THEN the system SHALL track workflow execution status
2. WHEN build steps execute THEN the system SHALL monitor each step's success or failure
3. WHEN commits are created THEN the system SHALL log commit details and changes
4. WHEN deployment completes THEN the system SHALL record deployment status and timing
5. IF workflow fails THEN the system SHALL capture detailed error logs and failure points

### Requirement 5: Production Site Update Monitoring

**User Story:** As a site owner, I want to monitor updates to the live production site mgrnz.com, so that I can verify content changes are successfully deployed and accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN site deployment completes THEN the system SHALL verify content is live on mgrnz.com
2. WHEN new content is published THEN the system SHALL validate the content appears correctly
3. WHEN site updates occur THEN the system SHALL check page load times and performance
4. WHEN deployment fails THEN the system SHALL detect and report site availability issues
5. IF content doesn't appear live THEN the system SHALL identify and report deployment gaps

### Requirement 6: End-to-End Pipeline Tracking

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive tracking of the entire pipeline from trigger to live site, so that I can monitor system health and identify bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any pipeline process starts THEN the system SHALL create a unique tracking ID
2. WHEN each stage completes THEN the system SHALL update the tracking record with timing and status
3. WHEN the pipeline completes THEN the system SHALL provide end-to-end timing and success metrics
4. WHEN issues occur THEN the system SHALL correlate problems across all pipeline stages
5. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL identify slow stages and provide optimization insights

### Requirement 7: Real-Time Dashboard and Alerting

**User Story:** As a site administrator, I want a real-time dashboard showing pipeline status and alerts, so that I can quickly identify and respond to issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display current pipeline status in real-time
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL send immediate alerts with error details
3. WHEN performance thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL trigger performance alerts
4. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL show historical trends and success rates
5. IF critical failures occur THEN the system SHALL provide escalation and notification mechanisms

### Requirement 8: Historical Data and Analytics

**User Story:** As a developer, I want historical data and analytics on pipeline performance, so that I can identify patterns and optimize the deployment process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing analytics THEN the system SHALL display pipeline performance trends over time
2. WHEN analyzing data THEN the system SHALL show success rates for each pipeline stage
3. WHEN reviewing history THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logs for troubleshooting
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL export data in multiple formats
5. IF patterns emerge THEN the system SHALL highlight recurring issues and suggest improvements
