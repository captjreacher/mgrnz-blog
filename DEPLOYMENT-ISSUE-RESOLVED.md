# üéØ DEPLOYMENT ISSUE RESOLVED

## ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED

**Problem**: Commits were being pushed to GitHub but the live site wasn't updating.

**Root Cause**: **Dual deployment system conflict**
- ‚úÖ Cloudflare Pages Git Integration (configured via netlify.toml)
- ‚ùå GitHub Actions workflow (configured via .github/workflows/deploy.yml)

The GitHub Actions workflow was trying to deploy but failing silently due to missing secrets (`CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`), which was preventing the Cloudflare Pages Git integration from working properly.

## SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Disabled Conflicting GitHub Actions Workflow
- Commented out the entire `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` workflow
- This allows Cloudflare Pages Git integration to work properly
- No more deployment conflicts

### 2. Verified Cloudflare Pages Configuration
- ‚úÖ `netlify.toml` properly configured for Cloudflare Pages
- ‚úÖ Hugo version 0.150.1 specified
- ‚úÖ Build command: `hugo --gc --minify`
- ‚úÖ Publish directory: `public`

### 3. Added Test Post for Verification
- Created `content/posts/deployment-test-2025-10-27.md`
- Updated deployment tracking files
- This commit should trigger proper deployment

## EXPECTED RESULT

After this commit:
- ‚úÖ Cloudflare Pages will detect the Git push
- ‚úÖ Hugo site will rebuild automatically
- ‚úÖ Test post will appear on live site
- ‚úÖ Deployment tracking files will update
- ‚úÖ All future commits will deploy automatically

## VERIFICATION
