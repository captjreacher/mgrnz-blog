# MailerLite Subscribe Form Setup

## âœ… What's Done
- MailerLite Universal script added to site head
- Subscribe page ready for form embed
- Script loads on every page (enables popups, embedded forms, etc.)

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

### 1. Get Your Form ID

1. Go to: https://dashboard.mailerlite.com/forms
2. Find your signup form (or create a new one)
3. Click on the form to edit it
4. Look at the URL - it will be something like:
   ```
   https://dashboard.mailerlite.com/forms/123456/edit
   ```
   The number `123456` is your Form ID

### 2. Update Subscribe Page

Open `content/subscribe.md` and replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` with your actual form ID:

```html
<!-- Change this: -->
<div class="ml-embedded" data-form="YOUR_FORM_ID"></div>

<!-- To this (example): -->
<div class="ml-embedded" data-form="123456"></div>
```

### 3. Alternative: Use Full Embed Code

If you prefer, you can replace the entire form section with MailerLite's full embed code:

1. In MailerLite dashboard, go to your form
2. Click "Publish" â†’ "Embedded form"
3. Copy the entire embed code
4. Replace the `<div class="ml-embedded"...>` line in `content/subscribe.md`

- Colors to match your brand (orange: #ff4f00)
