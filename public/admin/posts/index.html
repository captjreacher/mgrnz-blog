You can literally create, link a project, add some instructions and you'll be chatting.\\n﻿\\nBut moving any App into a production environment is not so easy. Sure, you can embed it easy enough into a webpage, that's what they were made for at one point, but to have your Assistant 'out in the wilderness' and ready to spring into action at any moment, well that's another thing entirely.\\nFor anyone to use your Assistant without essentially giving away your ChatGPT login, I don't recommend that of course! You have to host your Assistant somewhere, usually with a database under it and some code to make it all happen.\\n﻿\\nNow to host an App or a page that others will access, you have to present it in a stable state. You can't be throwing new code at it and rebuilding, redeploying it at your whim as your customers will lose access. No, you must respect the laws and principles of program change management, you must have a separate development environment, and program changes are packaged, scheduled and controlled so as to have minimal downtime for the production instance.\\n﻿\\nI use GitHub for change management and code integrity. You can't develop and deploy without it.\\n﻿\\n## Key features of the build\\n﻿\\nI chose to build a dashboard for this project that can provide a seamless interface for the user to run a basic email campaign. This becomes an asset for me that I can further develop and use as an entry point for customers for different automations.\\n- upload or create, edit leads\\n- submit leads to an automation job to verify email addresses\\n- submit leads to a predefined automated email campaign\\n- receive and process requests for samples\\n## How the assistant is delivered\\n\\nCentral chat interface is an OpenAI ‘Assistant’ which serves the user message interface. The method of delivery (to the customer), in this case, is by email, embedded in a button. The email recipient may choose to engage the Assistant by clicking the call to action, render.com will open a session and the customer engages with an Assistant that has a specific purpose.\\nA ‘virtual store’ is attached which contain knowledge materials (training)\\nTo enable real-time interaction with the Assistant, **Render.com** forms an ‘always live’ platform that hosts the Assistant for the duration of the interaction.  (Free tier winds down with inactivity and takes a little time to wind up when activated by a chat session. you can get around this with an automated ping when a user opens their email).\\nCode is managed via Github as the central repository.  Development is completed locally, and changes synched to Github (cloud).\\nIncoming leads can request contact (with or without samples requested) and the lead will flow back to the Contact Dashboard (and notify somebody)\\nIncoming requests for sample product will be logged by the Assistant and the request (and fulfilment will flow back to the Contact Dashboard)\\n﻿\\nThese build projects are not quick, they're not glamorous, it never works on the first go and you'll always have to debug. But they're a labour of love.\\n﻿\\n\\n\\n## Toolchain\\n\\n| Product | Use | URL |\\n|---|---|---|\\n| ChatGPT 5 | Coding, prompts, document writing, problem solving | https://chatgpt.com |\\n| OpenAI Assistant / Assistant API | Customer service agent (interface) | https://openai.com/platform |\\n| OpenAI Codex | Coding, debugging | https://chatgpt.com/codex |\\n| Google Jules (async coding agent) | Coding, debugging | https://jules.google |\\n| Postman | Debugging | https://postman.com |\\n| Render.com | App hosting | https://render.com |\\n| Notion | Knowledge DB, forms, workflow | https://notion.com |\\n| GitHub / Desktop | Code repository, change management | https://github.com |\\n| Make.com | Automated workflows | https://make.com |\\n\""</script><div class="grid grid-cols-12 gap-4 items-center"><div class=col-span-3><h4 class="text-sm font-semibold text-white truncate">Embedded ChatGPT Assistant by email</h4></div><div class=col-span-2><span class="inline-flex items-center rounded-full bg-green-100 px-2 py-1 text-xs font-medium text-green-800">✅ Published</span></div><div class=col-span-2><div class="text-sm text-white">Oct 28, 2025</div><div class="text-xs text-neutral-400">3 min read</div></div><div class=col-span-2><div class="flex flex-wrap gap-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center rounded bg-neutral-100 px-2 py-0.5 text-xs text-neutral-600">ChatGPT

With no objectives other than to explore, evaluate and validate some of the opportunities I had come across, my head was quickly spinning with ideas.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor 2-3 solid months I researched, then evaluated firsthand, AI products across several verticals. In most cases I used these products and compared them to their counterparts. I also discovered 'vibe-coding' and have developed a number of Apps now at various stages of development - all without knowing how to code.\\r\\n\\r\\nI knew I had a new mission: demystifying AI and empowering businesses to harness its' potential to free up resources that can be repurposed elsewhere. Automation by its nature, transforms the way we look at business processes and AI replaces repetitive and / or structured tasks as well as many unstructured. Automation is now possible on a level never seen before but that's not because AI has changed automation software. The advancement in automation software platforms is because of their connect-ability and useability; easy to use and will connect to almost anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nI eventually settled on a stable of favored products centered around Google, but there's no shortage of choice, so it's difficult to be anything but agnostic. The market is surging with exciting consumer-level AI products, driven by innovative startups capitalizing on the latest AI breakthroughs. But although the market is fertile for these AI driven solutions, it's not for the faint hearted. What's popular one day can lose their base subscribers overnight when a new player offers increased functionality, speed and / or reduced cost.\\r\\n\\r\\nCost remains a major driver, the closer a product gets to the consumer market the more pressure they face to either reduce subscription costs, offer a free tier or both. Nevertheless, the age-old economic adage \\\"there's no such thing as a free lunch\\\", still applies, you'll only get so far on a free subscription.\\r\\n\\r\\nOpening up your business to automation is a door to abundant choices. Rich functionality and a myriad of datasets await behind every API door, and you now have a key. Using platforms like make.com, n8n and zapier, businesses can now effortlessly tap into this treasure trove of options to do business smarter. Through API's you can introduce AI to your business processes down to the individual process step providing a world of options at every minute part of your operation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis blog and website are the outputs of this time but represent a distillation of my experiences through my career. I don't profess to have mastered all so I'm developing a library of supporting articles to plug certain gaps in the narrative. I hope that over time I can help others understand, not only automation and AI, but some of the building blocks of business.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo please hit the sign-up button below and I'll continue building my content resources without filling your inbox!\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n*Ready to explore AI for your business?

He would've been on LinkedIn!*\\r\\n\\r\\nMade just prior to Led Zeppelin's rise in popularity, his decision to shun the bookkeepers saved a black hole in the universe, the opportunity cost of life without Led Zeppelin. We wouldn't know any different of course, apart from a vague feeling of being somewhere *over the hills and far away*, or just constantly a little *dazed and confused*.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoincidentally, as Robert Plant had once pondered long and hard over his career choice, so too did I. But unlike Mr. Plant, I didn't have any offers on the table tempting me toward fame and fortune and of course I can't sing! It's no surprise then that I didn't hesitate before settling on Chartered Accounting as my ~~chosen~~ preferred vocation.\\r\\n\\r\\n### *Your Time is Gonna Come*\\r\\n\\r\\nIt wasn't until I set some personal goals that I started imagining my career. Accounting was always the easy choice, minimal university entry criteria, just turn up and you can be part of the oldest profession in the book…. or is second oldest, I can never remember?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the career you chose when you wanted to go drinking with your mates and make simple, yet safe decisions. I would have preferred to be the lead singer in a rock n' roll band, but it was the sensible and safe towers of the Big Six that called my name.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I set a big hairy audacious goal. I was working for the Big Six, they just didn't know it yet. It took me a couple of years to find their weakness, a chink in the armor, the soft underbelly of The Big 6 – small town New Zealand.\\r\\n\\r\\n31 years ago, I accepted my first career role at Coopers \\u0026 Lybrand, Tauranga, headcount 18, now 19. I came *in through the outdoor.* I was now a real accountant.\\r\\n\\r\\n### *Houses of the Holy*\\r\\n\\r\\nI was now a member of one of the greatest corporate memberships that ever existed, The Big Six. Pioneers of professionalism and integrity, the Mecca for business suave and excellence, institutional machines that churn out winners all day, every day.\\r\\n\\r\\nI spent 8 years in the Big 6, some of my fondest memories. It was a club. It was a party. It was a family. It was an education.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of all however, it has endured. The lessons became the basis of almost everything I've ever learnt, or ever will learn, about how a large business operates.\\r\\n\\r\\n- I learnt how to write reports that won't get you sued, others that get you sales and all of them had layers of review and made me look good in the end.\\r\\n\\r\\n- I learnt how Projects work **(SDLC)** and it was in this environment my long, and ongoing association with SAP began.\\r\\n\\r\\n- I learnt about software and computerized methodologies, frameworks that keep you on the straight and narrow, templates, workpapers, workflow. A wealth of IP that kept making me look good.\\r\\n\\r\\n- I learnt from great leaders. I recall an early client meeting with a PwC Partner at their largest client. Me - fresh faced, notes prepared, questions prepared, lots of questions, none of them got past the page. Partner rocks up, no pad, no notes, we blast in, he's firing from the hip, nails the meeting in record time and I come out with a months work scribbled on a page that I could hardly read. And more questions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"One day Robbo\\\", the Partner says, \\\"you'll be just like me.\\\" This became one of those motivating moments when you see the battle ahead of you, and pump your fists and shout, *\\\"No Quarter\\\".*\\r\\n\\r\\n### *No Quarter*\\r\\n\\r\\nThen one day I no longer needed to prepare for meetings like I once had, I could fire from the hip if I needed to. I was all grown up. I was a real accountant, and I had a badge to prove it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the time I left the Big 6, I had learnt the fundamentals of large business reporting, risk management and technology practices. Ironically, the medium for these lessons was predominantly via accounting processes, as it is the modern-day audit of technology, that drives the modern-day assurance of a company's financial statements.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you haven't been involved in a large audit, lucky you! You may not appreciate how technology drives much of a financial audit, it's just more efficient, subject to attestation of course. It essentially works like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n**Garbage in = Garbage out.**\\r\\n\\r\\n![Garbage In Equals Garbage Out](/images/2025/07/garbage-in-garbage-out.webp)\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so it goes, if your systems can be proven to deliver the right numbers (attestation), the financial statements are less likely to contain material errors. But if your systems are garbage, you've got a bunch of fresh-faced, overly enthusiastic audit graduates coming your way for the *Battle of Evermore.*\\r\\n\\r\\n### *I Can't Quit You Baby*\\r\\n\\r\\nI've spent the last 6 months immersing myself in AI and I'm here to tell you, it's real and it's evolving as quickly as you think.\\r\\n\\r\\nI've been amazed at how AI has evolved over 6 - 9 months. In that time I've:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Developed several brands\\r\\n- Learnt WordPress, built several websites and an automated Shopify store\\r\\n- Set up (Google) cloud infrastructure with program change control through Github\\r\\n- Developed several Apps, dashboards, forms and API integrations\\r\\n- Cloned and customized open source products\\r\\n- Set up automations using make.com\\r\\n\\r\\nThere's more, I didn't really touch on AI, although AI is what this *Ramble On* is all about.\\r\\n\\r\\n### *Rock and Roll*\\r\\n\\r\\nI set up a business. It's called Maximised AI. [www.maximisedai.com](https://maximisedai.com)\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's a blend of my 30+ years with a pinch of AI and some collaborations.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'll be writing about it, this is my Blog. Please support me and *Sign Up to My Blog.*\\r\\n\\r\\nI'll be consulting and helping businesses get AI on board, get better visibility of and access to data, tactically automate and reallocate resources.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently looking for pilot clients, get in touch if you want to chat about your business.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### **I'm Bootstrapping the AI Evolution….(I'm broke!).**\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cdiv style=\\\"text-align: center; margin: 30px 0;\\\"\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cscript type=\\\"text/javascript\\\" src=\\\"https://cdnjs.buymeacoffee.com/1.0.0/button.prod.min.js\\\" data-name=\\\"bmc-button\\\" data-slug=\\\"mgrnz\\\" data-color=\\\"#ff6905\\\" data-emoji=\\\"\\\"  data-font=\\\"Cookie\\\" data-text=\\\"Buy me a coffee\\\" data-outline-color=\\\"#000000\\\" data-font-color=\\\"#000000\\\" data-coffee-color=\\\"#FFDD00\\\" \\u003e\\u003c/script\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/div\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n###### References:\\r\\n###### ¹ Netflix series, NZ July 2025\""</script><div class="grid grid-cols-12 gap-4 items-center"><div class=col-span-3><h4 class="text-sm font-semibold text-white truncate">Bootstrapping the AI Evolution – The Journey from Accountant to AI Entrepreneur</h4></div><div class=col-span-2><span class="inline-flex items-center rounded-full bg-green-100 px-2 py-1 text-xs font-medium text-green-800">✅ Published</span></div><div class=col-span-2><div class="text-sm text-white">Jul 7, 2025</div><div class="text-xs text-neutral-400">6 min read</div></div><div class=col-span-2><div class="flex flex-wrap gap-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center rounded bg-neutral-100 px-2 py-0.5 text-xs text-neutral-600">AI
