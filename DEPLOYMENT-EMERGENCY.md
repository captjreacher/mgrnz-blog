### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED:

#### 1. CHECK CLOUDFLARE PAGES DASHBOARD
- Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com/
- Navigate to: Pages ‚Üí mgrnz-blog
- Check: Recent deployments
- Look for: Failed builds or wrong branch

#### 2. VERIFY BUILD SETTINGS

- **Hugo version**: Should be `0.150.1` or latest
- **Branch**: Should be `main`

#### 3. CHECK REPOSITORY CONNECTION

- Check: Webhook is active
- Confirm: Latest commits are visible in Pages dashboard

#### 4. MANUAL DEPLOYMENT TRIGGER
- In Cloudflare Pages dashboard
- Click: "Create deployment"
- Select: Latest commit from main branch
- Force: Manual rebuild

### ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS:

#### Option A: Reconnect Repository
1. Disconnect GitHub repository
2. Reconnect with fresh permissions
3. Reconfigure build settings

#### Option B: Create New Pages Project
1. Create new Cloudflare Pages project
2. Connect to same GitHub repo
3. Update DNS to point to new project

#### Option C: Check Build Logs

2. Check build logs for errors
3. Look for Hugo version issues or missing files

### EXPECTED TIMELINE:
- Manual deployment: 3-5 minutes
- Repository reconnection: 10-15 minutes
- New project setup: 20-30 minutes

### SUCCESS INDICATORS:
